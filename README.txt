OMFGDOGS!

1. 	The work correctly tiles the gif image and loops the audio
	for chrome and IE9 (audio not working in firefox). The link
	at the bottom sends the user to the original site.
2. 	This work was done independtly by Mical Nobel
3. 	I spent ~2.5 hours on this although a good chunk of that was
	spent learning about git and vim

Please check out in chrome for best results!  :)
